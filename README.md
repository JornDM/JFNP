# JFNP
Jorn's First Networking Project (JFNP) is my first personal project in which I will construct a fully functioning network using Vagrant and Ansible.
Feel free to use the code that I wrote in your own projects! And give this projet a star ;). 
The hostname of all the VM's are the names of the letters in the Latin Alphabet. 

## Contents 
This project has the following servers/machines:
1. A database server 
  * name: Alpha (VM-name: db)
  * type of database service: mariadb 
  

## How to Deploy? 
TODO...
